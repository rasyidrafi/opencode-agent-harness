/**
 * Identity model for the harness contract.
 *
 * The host (OpenCode) owns canonical ids for sessions, turns, messages, tool
 * items, and runtime requests. A harness may have its own ids; those are
 * reported as opaque native references and are never used by the host as
 * primary keys.
 *
 * `strength` tells the host how far a native id can be trusted:
 * - `strong`: stable across process restarts; safe to persist and resume from.
 * - `weak`: valid only while the live session/process is alive.
 * - `none`: the harness does not expose this kind of id.
